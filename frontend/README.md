# Coding Practices

### Naming Approach

- Each folder should have it's own test folder named **test**
- Try to compartmentalise component as much as possible

#### Pages

- Pages should be created in pages folder. Separate folder for separate pages
- Naming for pages file should be filename.page.js
- Naming style for test file should be filename.page.unit.test

#### Component

- Component should be created in component folder. Separate folder for separate pages
- Naming for component file should be filename.component.js
- Naming style for test file should be filename.component.unit.test

### Use makestyle for CSS
